# COGS118B_Project
This is the repository for the COGS 118B Project of Sohaib,Steven, Alexander, and Simon

his project mainly focuses on a comprehensive analysis to decode the factors contributing to NBA teams’ success from machine learning techniques. By merging datasets, and leveraging thorough datasets, we would use unsupervised learning techniques including PCA, different prediction models, and hierarchical clustering techniques to help us identify the attributes of the success of teams. We aim to include insights into the teams’ performance and other factors behind the performance such as management of teams to make an evaluation and prediction for future related sports and players’ contributions. By doing so, we intend to offer valuable evaluations and predictions that can inform future sports analytics, player contributions, and team strategies. Furthermore, our findings are poised to assist current and future team managers in evaluating their strategies and identifying key areas of focus to enhance their chances of success. Similar models and techniques are also able to help predict and stand for other sports evaluations in their chances of success.
