    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "This project mainly focuses on a comprehensive analysis to decode the factors contributing to football teams’ success from machine learning techniques. By merging datasets, and leveraging thorough datasets, we would use unsupervised learning techniques including PCA, different prediction models, and hierarchical clustering techniques to help us identify the attributes of the success of teams. We aim to include insights into the teams’ performance and other factors behind the performance such as management of teams to make an evaluation and prediction for future related sports and players’ contributions. By doing so, we intend to offer valuable evaluations and predictions that can inform future sports analytics, player contributions, and team strategies. Furthermore, our findings are poised to assist current and future team managers in evaluating their strategies and identifying key areas of focus to enhance their chances of success. Similar models and techniques are also able to help predict and stand for other sports evaluations in their chances of success.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the intersection of sports and data analytics has become an increasingly significant area of research, offering a wealth of insights into the intricacies of team dynamics, player contributions, and overall performance. As the popularity of sports analytics continues to rise, the application of machine learning techniques to unravel the factors influencing the success of football teams has garnered particular attention <a name=\"first paper\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#first). This project aims to delve into a comprehensive analysis utilizing unsupervised machine learning methodologies to determine the complex elements contributing to the success of American football teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal of our research is to provide valuable insights that go beyond simple retrospective analyses, seeking to understand underlying factors driving team success and develop predictive models that can evaluate future outcomes <a name=\"second paper\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#second). The basis of the evaluations not only encompasses team performance but also takes into account individual player contributions to suggest a holistic perspective on team performance dynamics. The results and models from this project can assist both current and future team managers in evaluating their chances of success. Beyond this, the models and techniques have the potential to be adapted for predicting success in other sports, thereby broadening the applicability and impact of the current research in sports analytics <a name=\"third paper\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#third).\n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the possible features that make various soccer teams successful, we would like to use PCA to first perform dimensionality reduction on our dataset, then perform hierarchical clustering to group these soccer teams based on their success-related features. Soccer teams' success metrics involve multiple variables(team offensive/defensive metrics, individual player talent metrics, team/player salaries, etc.), which can lead to a high-dimensional dataset. Using PCA, we can reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, emphasizing variation and bringing out strong patterns in a dataset. At the same time, by focusing on the principal components with the most variance, PCA helps to filter out noise from less significant variables. Since PCA is sensitive to the variances of the features, we can start by standardizing the dataset using StandardScaler from scikit-learn for this purpose. After that, we can implement the PCA class in scikit-learn and use the function pca.fit_transform() to get the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the dimensionality-reduced data, we will apply hierarchical clustering to group the soccer teams based on their similarities across the principal components. This method of hierarchical clustering produces a dendrogram that visualizes the clustering process, offering insights into the data's structure; we believe that this can help in identifying relationships between teams based on their success metrics. In addition, hierarchical clustering can capture complex relationships between data points, which can be beneficial if the success factors of soccer teams are not linearly separable. We will be using the common agglomerative(bottom-up) approach by importing the AgglomerativeClustering class from scikit-learn, and we can initialize the clusterings using AgglomerativeClustering() and fit the model using clustering.fit(). We will then analyze the clusters to identify common features or attributes within each group and see what makes the most successful cluster of teams stand out from the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a benchmark model, we could use K-Means clustering with a predefined number of clusters, where the number of clusters will be based on the number of tiers of team performance typically observed in soccer leagues. This benchmark can help us evaluate the effectiveness of our hierarchical clustering approach."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of both the hierarchical clustering and the benchmark model(K-Means), we will be using the Silhouette Score  as our evaluation metrics. The mathematical representation of the Silhouette Score is S=(b-a)/max(a,b), where a is the average distance between the sample and all other points in the same cluster and b is the average distance between the sample and all points in the nearest cluster. This metric measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters and a high score indicates that the sample is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If the silhouette score for our hierarchical clustering is lower than the benchmark model, that means our hierarchical clustering isn’t performing well on the dataset."

    "We will ensure that any personal or sensitive information about individuals, such as fans or players, is handled with care and in accordance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. Additionally, we will have to be mindful of potential biases in the data that could unfairly impact certain groups of fans or players.

    "All methods and datasets will be made open-source so as to maintain transparency about the study. We will also document any assumptions, limitations, or uncertainties associated with the analysis to ensure that stakeholders or interested parties have an informative picture of the potential implications of the findings and how they may influence decision-making.\n",
    "## Impact on Players and Teams:\n",
    "Perhaps most importantly, we will have to consider the potential impact of the analysis on players, teams, and other stakeholders. Drawing conclusions that could harm reputations or lead to unfair treatment will have to be seriously considered and accurately represented in our report."
